/* uECC_RNG_Function type
The RNG function should fill 'size' random bytes into 'dest'. It should return 1 if
'dest' was filled with random data, or 0 if the random data could not be generated.
The filled-in values should be either truly random, or from a cryptographically-secure PRNG.

A correctly functioning RNG function must be set (using swECC_set_rng()) before calling
swECC_make_key() or uECC_sign().

Setting a correctly functioning RNG function improves the resistance to side-channel attacks
for swECC_shared_secret() and uECC_sign_deterministic().

A correct RNG function is set by default when building for Windows, Linux, or OS X.
If you are building on another POSIX-compliant system that supports /dev/random or /dev/urandom,
you can define uECC_POSIX to use the predefined RNG. For embedded platforms there is no predefined
RNG function; you must provide your own.

be called before swECC_make_key() or uECC_sign() are used.

This is used to pass in an arbitrary hash function to uECC_sign_deterministic().

is computed, init_hash() will be called, followed by one or more calls to
update_hash(), and finally a call to finish_hash() to produce the resulting hash.

The intention is that you will create a structure that includes uECC_HashContext
followed by any hash-specific data. For example:

typedef struct SHA256_HashContext {
    uECC_HashContext uECC;
    SHA256_CTX ctx;
} SHA256_HashContext;

void init_SHA256(uECC_HashContext *base) {

}

... when signing ...

    SHA256_HashContext ctx = {{&init_SHA256, &update_SHA256, &finish_SHA256, 64, 32, tmp}};
    uECC_sign_deterministic(key, message_hash, &ctx.uECC, signature);

/* uECC_sign_deterministic() function.
Generate an ECDSA signature for a given hash value, using a deterministic algorithm

this function; however, if the RNG is defined it will improve resistance to side-channel
attacks.

Inputs:

    hash_context - A hash context to use.

Outputs:
    signature - Will be filled in with the signature value.

Returns 1 if the signature generated successfully, 0 if an error occurred.

Check to see if a public key is valid.

functions. However, you may wish to avoid spending CPU time computing a shared secret or
verifying a signature using an invalid public key.
