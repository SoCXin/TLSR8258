/* hECC_RNG_Function type
The RNG function should fill 'size' random bytes into 'dest'. It should return 1 if
'dest' was filled with random data, or 0 if the random data could not be generated.
The filled-in values should be either truly random, or from a cryptographically-secure PRNG.
A correctly functioning RNG function must be set (using hECC_set_rng()) before calling
hECC_make_key(). */
