 *   dma mode:
 *   		   all sram(64k area form 0x40000~0x4ffff, address 3 byte) could be used for reading or writing data buffer,
 *             i2c master just need send sram address(3 byte) on i2c bus in i2c reading or writing, reading/writing
 *             sram address could be anywhere and could be different.
 *			   i2c master timing is:
 *              	1.master write:  start + device_id(W) + address2+ address1 + address0 + data(1,2...n byte)  +  stop
 *                  2.master read:   start + device_id(W) + address2+ address1 + address0 + start + device_id(R) + data(1,2...n byte) + stop
 *
 *   mapping mode:
 *  			i2c slave data buffer sram could be configured by function: void i2c_slave_mapping_mode_data_buffer_config(unsigned char * pMapBuf),
 *              and it is also configured in function: void i2c_slave_init(unsigned char device_ID,I2C_SlaveMode mode,unsigned char * pMapBuf)
 *   			reading/writing data buffer configured by pMapBuf addressed in core_e1/e2/e3,
 *   		    for i2c master: writing data buffer is pMapBuf,and reading data buffer is (pMapBuf+64) (this offset 64 is managed by MCU hardware, user can not change it)
 *
 *              i2c master no need send any address when reading or writing data, which means i2c master timing is:
 *              	1.master write:  start + device_id(W) + data(1,2...n byte)  +  stop
 *                  2.master read:   start + device_id(W) + start + device_id(R) + data(1,2...n byte) + stop
